    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      The goal of the ONVIF test specification set is to make it possible to realize fully interoperable IP physical security implementation from different vendors. The set of ONVIF test specification describes the test cases need to verify the [ONVIF DeviceIO Service Specs] and [ONVIF Conformance] requirements. It also describes the test framework, test setup, pre-requisites, test policies needed for the execution of the described test cases.
    </para>
    <para>
      This ONVIF Recording Control Test Specification acts as a supplementary document to the [ONVIF Network Interface Specs], illustrating test cases need to be executed and passed. Also, this specification acts as an input document to the development of test tool which will be used to test the ONVIF device implementation conformance towards ONVIF standard. This test tool is referred as ONVIF Client hereafter.
    </para>
    <section xml:id="s.intro.scope">
      <title>Scope</title>
      <para>
        This ONVIF Recording Control Test Specification defines and regulates the conformance testing procedure for the ONVIF conformant devices. Conformance testing is meant to be functional black-box testing. The objective of this specification is to provide the test cases to test individual requirements of ONVIF devices according to ONVIF core services which are defined in [ONVIF Network Interface Specs].

        The set of ONVIF Test Specification will not cover the complete set of requirements as defined in [ONVIF Network Interface Specs]; instead it would cover subset of it. The scope of this specification is to derive all the normative requirements of [ONVIF DeviceIO Service Specs] which are related to ONVIF Device IO Service and some of the optional requirements.

          According to later version of [ONVIF Network Interface Specs], it requires ONVIF client to support both HTTP digest and WS-UsernameToken functionality as authentication functionality. Therefore, ONVIF Client (ONVIF Device Test Tool in this context) as a testing framework shall properly select authentication method between the two based on the response from DUT toward specific request. The following is the deterministic procedure on which authentication method is to be selected.
